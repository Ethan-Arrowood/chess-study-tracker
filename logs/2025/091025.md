  - Ch. 1: Drills Review
    - Notes: I have a hard time with the vision on some of these missing obvious pawn forks and what not.
- Bot game 1: https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/computer/395428899/review
  - I had black against a 1375 bot
  - Lost due to checkmate because I blundered my Knight in the endgame.
  - Opening sequence; some form of scandinavian i think
  ```
  1. e4 d5
  2. Nc3 d4
  3. Nce2 e5
  4. f4 Nc6
  ```
  - Missed a tactic in the opening where I could have won a Knight by trading my bishop and then using a pin.
  - Actually had two moments to take advantage of this tactic, but I was focussed on setting up a strong center and getting my king out of center.
  - Missed another pin in the mid game.
  - Going into the endgame I was up on pawn with a black bishop and knight, my opponent had both bishops. I had stronger pawn structure with connected pawns on `h` and `g` file, and on `c-a` files. My opponent had one isolated pawn on `h`, another isolated on `d`, and then connected pawns on `b` and `a` files.
  - I found some decent knight forks in the late game winning more pawns
  - ...And then I blundered my Knight losing the game. Notably, I made this move with 6:25 on the clock! Absolutely need to slow down especially with so much time on my clock.
  - Finally, I tried to still pull out a win, I managed to sorta break through with my connected pawns, but it was too little too late. My opponent had connected pawns on `d` and `c` now and I couldn't defend.
  - Lessons:
    - I spent little time calculating in the opening; I should consider alternatives and see if there are tactics available to me early on.
    - Sometimes I don't always have to follow principles such as getting the king out of the center; especially if my tactic wouldn't compromise my king safety.
    - Look for pins! Even if they may not seem immediately useful, they can create tactical opportunities.
    - Take your time! With longer time controls, there's no rush to make a move. Use the time to calculate and find the best move. Better to lose on time then to make a blunder.
    - Don't feel pressured to play as fast as the opponent.
- Bot game 2: https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/computer/395452497/review
  - I had black against a 1375 bot
  - Won with checkmate
  - Opening sequence; some form of scandinavian i think
  ```
  1. e4 d5
  2. Nf3 dxe4
  3. Ng5 Nf6
  ```
  - My 3rd opening move was considered an inaccuracy, I should have played `e5` because even if the knight recaptures on `e4`, I have now prepared both of my bishops for development. The best follow up to `4. Nxe4` is `4...Nc6` taking control of the center.
  - I missed an intermezzo tactic by trading queens with check that would have led to me being up a Knight
  - However, even without that, my opponent was playing so poorly the eval was -3.65 by move 5!
  - I played a little weird, but with such a dominating lead it didn't matter
  - My goal was to develop my pieces and create some threats. Opponent did well to also defend and develop but left their king in the center for far too long. They didn't necessarily have a decent castle anyways but I recognized this and was trying to break open the center.
  - I missed a tactic to simplify the position. I was up 2 pawns so I should have considered that more heavily. Reflecting, I remember not realizing I was up that material and was still focussing on trying to break through the middle.
  - Nonetheless I played solidly pushing my pawns on the queenside.
  - I really cemented my win when I got my Queen on to the second rank and started cleaning up pawns. This lead to me being up 4 pawns and then I traded off my queen going into an endgame with an unobstructed queenside pawn wall.
  - Wasn't much of an endgame as I had such a big lead I simply checked the king to the h file, promoted a pawn, and checkmated with over 2 minutes on the clock.
  - Lessons:
    - Don't be afraid to calculate in the opening too; sometimes I won't know a line and that is okay
    - When up material look for opportunities to simplify
    - Used my time significantly better this game
