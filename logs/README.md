# Study Session Log + Game Analysis

Its important to track sessions over time to understand how honest I'm being to my plan and if I need to make any adjustments. Notes on openings should go in their respective pages/sections (just root README for now, but likely individual pages eventually). The individual session logs in this folder are organized by date. They should detail what I did and include any lessons learned. They will also include the game analyses completed. Though I may separate those out too.
