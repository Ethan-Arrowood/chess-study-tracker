# Chess Study

A collection of resources, notes, and plans to help improve my chess skills.

## Core Philosophy

**Process over results** - focus on learning, not rating protection

**Quality over quantity** - structured study beats random games

**Consistency beats intensity** - regular practice is more effective than sporadic bursts of study.

**Before every move, ask: What is my opponent's threat?**

## Game Analysis Questions

- Quick Win Games (5min)
  - What was the winning move?
  - Could I have improved my calculation in anyway or did I truly find the best move(s)?
- Quick Blunder Games (5min)
  - What move was the blunder?
  - What should I have calculated differently?
- Good/close games (10-15min)
  - What was my middle game plan?
  - Can I identify any key moments that shifted the game's momentum?
    - For example, a lead from the opening, a tactical calculation in the middlegame, or a critical endgame decision.
  - If I lost, where did I first go wrong? What should I have calculated differently?
- Time Loss (5-10min)
  - Did I spend too much time on any one move?
  - How can I improve my time management in future games?
  - Aside from losing on time was there anything else that contributed to my loss?

## Opening Repertoire

Focus on practicality. Study what I'm actually experiencing and don't get lost in complex theory that never gets used!

When taking notes on openings, focus on key ideas, plans, and potential pitfalls rather than memorizing long lines of theory.

Keep these questions in mind and try to detail summaries for quick review:

1. What stands out about the opening that is key to remember?
2. What are the main ideas for both sides in this opening?
3. What are the common plans and pitfalls?
